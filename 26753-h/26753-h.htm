<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>PROCLAMATION OF HENRY VIII. AGAINST THE
POSSESSION OF RELIGIOUS BOOKS.</h3>

  <p>The progress of the Reformation in England must have been greatly
  affected by the extent to which the art of printing was brought to bear
  upon the popular mind. Before the charms of Anne Boleyn could have had
  much effect, or "doubts" had troubled the royal conscience, Wolsey had
  been compelled to forbid the introduction or printing of books and tracts
  calculated to increase the unsettled condition of the faith.</p>

  <p>The following proclamation, now for the first time printed, may have
  originated in the ineffectual result of the cardinal's directions. The
  readers of Strype and Fox will see that the threats which both contain
  were no idle ones, and that men were indeed "corrected and punisshed for
  theyr contempte and disobedience, to the terrible example of other lyke
  trangressours."</p>

  <p>The list of books prohibited by the order of 1526 contains all those
  mentioned by name in the present proclamation, except the <i>Summary of
  Scripture</i>; and it will be seen that such full, general terms are used
  that no obnoxious production could escape, if brought to light. The
  <i>Revelation of Antichrist</i> was written by Luther.</p>

  <p>Strype does not seem to have been aware of the existence of this
  particular proclamation, which was issued in the year 1530. Under the
  year 1534 (<i>Ecclesiastical Memorials, &amp;c.</i>, Oxford, 1822, vol.
  i. part i. p. 253.), he thus refers to what he thought to be the first
  royal proclamation upon the subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Much light was let in among the common people by the New Testament
  and other good books in English, which, for the most part being printed
  beyond sea, were by stealth brought into England, and dispersed here by
  well-disposed men. For the preventing the importation and using of these
  books, the king this year issued out a strict proclamation, by the
  petition of the clergy now met in Convocation, in the month of
  December.</p>

  <p>"Nor was this the first time such books were prohibited to be brought
  in: for us small quantities of them were secretly conveyed into these
  parts from time to time, for the discovering, in that dark age, the <!--
  Page 422 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page422"></a>{422}</span>gross
  papal innovations, as well in the doctrine of the Sacrament as in
  image-worship, addressing to saints, purgatory, pilgrimages, and the
  like.</p>

  <p>"A previous order (in the year 1526) was issued by the Bishop of
  London, by the instigation of Cardinal Wolsey, calling in all English
  translations of the Scripture. And other books of this nature were then
  forbid."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This proclamation, therefore, well merits preservation in your pages,
  as one of the hitherto unknown "evidences" of the terrible and trying
  times to which it refers.</p>

  <p>It shows, too, the value of the class of papers upon which the Society
  of Antiquaries are bestowing so much attention. The original was found
  among a miscellaneous collection in the Chapter House, Westminster.</p>

  <p>The Kinge, oure most dradde soveraigne lorde, studienge and providynge

  suggestion of our gostly enemy, partly by the yvell and perverse
  inclination and sedicious disposition of sundry persons, divers heresies
  and erronio[us] [o]pinions have ben late sowen and spredde amonge his
  subjectes of this his said realme, by blasphemous and pestiferous
  englishe bokes, printed in other regions and sent into this realme, to
  the entent as well to perverte and withdrawe the people from the
  catholike and true fayth of Christe, as also to stirre and incense them
  to sedition and disobedience agaynst their princes, soveraignes, and
  heedes, as also to cause them to contempne and neglect all good lawes,
  customes, and vertuous maners, to the final subversion and desolacion of
  this noble realme, if they myght have prevayled (which God forbyd) in
  theyr most cursed [p]ersuasions and malicious purposes. Where upon the
  kynges hignes (<i>sic</i>), by his incomparable wysedome, forseinge and
  most prudently considerynge, hath invited and called to hym the primates
  of this his gracis realme, and also a sufficient nombre of discrete,
  vertuous, and well-lerned personages in divinite, as well of either of

  consulted, debated, inserched, and discussed the premisses: and finally,
  by all their free assentes, consentes, and agrementes, concluded,
  resolved, and determyned, that these bokes ensuynge, that is to say, the

  Revelation of Antichrist, the Summary of Scripture, and divers other

<h3>LATIN&mdash;LATINER.</h3>

  <p>It is interesting to note the great variety of significations in which
  the word Latin has been used. Sometimes it means Italian, sometimes
  Spanish, sometimes the Romance language. Again, it has been used as
  synonymous with language, learning, discourse; or to express that a
  matter is plain and intelligible. <!-- Page 424 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page424"></a>{424}</span></p>

  <p>Muratori, in describing the "Cangiamento dell' Lingua Latina nella
  volgare Italiana," observes,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Così a poco a poco il volgo di questa bella Provincia [Italia], oltre
  adottare moltissimi vocaboli forestieri, andò ancora alterando i proprj,
  cioè i Latini, cambiando le terminazioni delle parole, accorciandole,
  allungandole, e corrompendole. In somma se ne formò un nuovo Linguaggio,
  che <i>Volgare</i> si appellava, perchè usato dal <i>Volgo
  d'Italia.</i>"&mdash;Muratori, <i>Della Perfetta Poesia Italiana</i>,
  tomo i. p. 6., ed. Venez., 1730.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So Boccaccio, giving an account of the intention of his poem, the
  "Teseide," writes,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ma tu, o libro, primo al lor cantare</p>
      <p>Di Marte fai gli affanni sostenuti,</p>
      <p>Nel <i>vulgar latino</i> mai non veduti,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>where, as in the letter to La Fiammetta, prefixed to this poem,
  <i>vulgar latino</i> is evidently Italian ("Trovata una antichissima
  storia ... in <i>latino volgare</i> ... ho ridotta"), and not the
  Provençal tongue, as Mr. Craik suggests in his <i>Literature and Learning
  in England</i>, vol. ii. p. 48., where he supposes Boccaccio to have
  translated <i>from</i>, and not, as is clear, <i>into</i>, <i>latino
  volgare</i>.</p>

  <p>Dante repeatedly uses Latino for Italiano, as in <i>Purgatorio</i>,
  xi. 58.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Io fui Latino, e nato d'un gran Tosco."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And in <i>Inf.</i> xxii. 65.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Conosci tu alcun, che sia Latino."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Paradiso</i>, iii. 63.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sì che il raffigurar m' è più <i>latino</i>,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>latino</i> evidently means easy, clear, plain. "Forse contrario di
  barbaro, strano," says Volpi, "noi Lombardi in questo significato diciamo
  <i>ladin</i>." The "discreto latino" of Thomas Aquinas, elsewhere in
  <i>Paradiso</i> (xii. 144.), must mean "sage discourse." Chaucer, when he
  invokes the muse, in the proeme to the second book of "Troilus and
  Creseide," only asks her for rhyme, because, saith he,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Of no sentement I this endite,</p>
      <p>But out of <i>Latine</i> in my tongue it write."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Where "Latine," of course, means Boccaccio's <i>Filostrato</i>, from
  which Chaucer's poem is taken.</p>

  <p>In the "Poema del Cid," <i>latinado</i> seems to mean person
  conversant with the Spanish or Romance language of the period:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Quando esta falsedad dicien los de Carrion,</p>
      <p>Un Moro <i>Latinado</i> bien gelo entendio."&mdash;v. 2675.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. Ticknor remarks, that when the Christian conquests were pushed on
  towards the south of Spain, the Moors, who remained inclosed in the
  Christian population, and spoke or assumed its language, were originally
  called <i>Moros Latinados</i>; and refers to the <i>Cronica General</i>,
  where, respecting Alfaraxi, a Moor, afterwards converted, and a
  counsellor of the Cid, it is said he was "de tan buen entendimento, e era
  tan <i>ladino</i> que semejava Christiano."&mdash;Ticknor, <i>Hist. Span.
  Lit.</i>, iii. 347.</p>

  <p>Cervantes (<i>Don Q.</i> Parte I. cap. xli.) uses <i>ladino</i> to
  mean Spanish:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Servianos de interprete a las mas destas palabras y razones el padre
  de Zoraida como mas <i>ladino</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Latin, in fact, was so much <i>the</i> language as to become almost
  synonymous with <i>a</i> language. So a <i>Latiner</i> was an
  interpreter, as it is very well expressed in Selden's <i>Table Talk</i>,
  art. "Language":</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Latimer is the corruption of <i>Latiner</i>: it signifies he that
  interprets Latin; and though he interpreted French, Spanish, or Italian,
  he was the king's Latiner, that is, the king's interpreter."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This use of the word is well illustrated in the following
  extracts:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A Knight ther language lerid in youth;</p>
      <p>Breg hight that Knight, born Bretoun,</p>
      <p>That lerid the language of Sessoun.</p>
      <p>This Breg was the <i>Latimer</i>,</p>
      <p>What scho said told Vortager."&mdash;Robert de Brunne's <i>Metrical Chronicle.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Par soen demein <i>latinier</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>
      <p>Icil Morice iert <i>latinier</i></p>
      <p>Al rei Dermot, ke mult l'out cher."&mdash;<i>Norman-French Chronicle of Conquest of Ireland</i>, edited by F. Michel (as quoted in Wright's <i>Essays</i>, vol. ii. p. 215.).</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I here conclude, as I must not seek to monopolise space required for
  more valuable contributions.</p>

<h3>INEDITED POEMS.</h3>

  <p>I send you two poems which I have found in a little rough scrap-book
  of a literary character of last century, and which, not having myself met
  with in print, I trust you will consider worth preserving in your pages.
  The one styled "A Scotch Poem on the King and the Queen of the Fairies,"
  has a vein of playful satire running through it, but I do not detect any
  word which justifies the ascription of its paternity to Scotland. Perhaps
  some of your readers would oblige me by indicating the source from which
  this poem has been taken, if it is already in print.</p>

  <p>A SCOTCH POEM ON THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Upon a time the Fairy Elves,</p>
      <p>Being first array'd themselves,</p>
      <p>Thought it meet to clothe their King</p>
      <p>In robes most fit for revelling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He had a cobweb shirt more thin</p>
      <p>Than ever spider since could spin,</p>
      <p>Bleach'd in the whiteness of the snow,</p>
      <p>When that the northern winds do blow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
<!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page425"></a>{425}</span>
      <p>A rich waistcoat they did him bring,</p>
      <p>Made of the troutfly's golden wing,</p>
      <p>Dy'd crimson in a maiden's blush,</p>
      <p>And lin'd in humming-bees' soft plush.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>His hat was all of lady's love,</p>
      <p>So passing light, that it would move</p>
      <p>If any gnat or humming fly</p>
      <p>But beat the air in passing by.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>About it went a wreath of pearl,</p>
      <p>Dropt from the eyes of some poor girl,</p>
      <p>Pinch'd because she had forgot</p>
      <p>To leave clean water in the pot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>His breeches and his cassock were</p>
      <p>Made of the tinsel gossamer;</p>
      <p>Down by its seam there went a lace</p>
      <p>Drawn by an urchin snail's slow pace.</p>

      <p>No sooner was their King attir'd</p>

      <p>Of shining thread shot from the sun</p>
      <p class="i1">And twisted into line,</p>

      <p class="i1">Was made her smock so fine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Her gown was ev'ry colour fair,</p>

      <p>Her necklace was of subtle tye</p>
      <p class="i1">Of glorious atoms, set</p>
      <p>In the pure black of beauty's eye</p>
      <p class="i1">As they had been in jet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The revels ended, she put off,</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barbauld wrote the following lines on a scroll within a kind of
  wreath, which hung over the chimney, the whole parlour being decorated
  with branches of ivy, which were made to run down the walls and hang down
  every pannel in festoons, at a country place called Palgrave:</p>

      <p>There exert they joyless reign.</p>
      <p>Triumph o'er the wither'd flow'r,</p>
      <p>The leafless shrub, the ruin'd bower;</p>
      <p>But our cottage come not near,</p>
      <p>Other Springs inhabit here,</p>
      <p>Other sunshine decks our board</p>
      <p>Than they niggard skies afford.</p>
      <p>Gloomy Winter, hence away,</p>
      <p>Love and fancy scorn they sway;</p>
      <p>Love, and joy, and friendly mirth</p>
      <p>Shall bless this roof, these walls, this hearth,</p>

<h3>ROUND TOWERS OF THE CYCLADES.</h3>

  <p>On Friday evening, Nov. 19, 1852, a lecture was delivered before the
  members of the Literary and Scientific Institute of this island, by Capt.
  Graves, R.N., from which I have been permitted to take the following
  extract. The information contained in it, will doubtless be the more
  interesting to many of the reader of "N. &amp; Q.," when informed that
  the round towers of Greece are fast disappearing; either from being
  pulled down for the erection of dwellings, or to be burnt into lime, by
  the Greeks who dwell in their neighbourhood. What the original dimensions
  of these towers may have been in ancient times, or for what purposes they
  were erected, are alike unknown; but their present proportions are as
  follow, and drawn by the learned lecturer from personal observation:</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Songs and Rimes of Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;I find in Mr. J.&nbsp;P.
  Collier's <i>History of Dramatic Poetry</i> (a work replete with dramatic
  lore and anecdote) the following note in p. 275., vol. iii.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Mitre and the Mermaid were celebrated taverns, which the poets,
  wits, and gallants were accustomed to visit. Mr. Thorpe, the enterprising
  bookseller of Bedford Street, is in possession of a manuscript full of
  songs and poems, in the handwriting of a person of the name of Richard
  Jackson, all copied prior to the year 1631, and including many
  unpublished pieces, by a variety of celebrated poets. One of the most
  curious is a song in five seven-line stanzas, thus headed: 'Shakespeare's
  Rime, which he made at the Mytre in Fleete Streete.' It begins: 'From the
  rich Lavinian shore;' and some few of the lines were published by
  Playford, and set as a catch. Another shorter piece is called in the
  margin,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg1">'<span class="sc">Shakespeare's Rime.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Give me a cup of rich Canary wine,</p>
      <p>Which was the Mitres (drink) and now is mine;</p>
      <p>Of which had Horace and Anacreon tasted,</p>
      <p>Their lives as well as lines till now had lasted.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"I have little doubt," adds Mr. Collier, "that the lines are genuine,
  as well as many other songs and poems attributed to Ben Jonson, Sir W.
  Raleigh, H. Constable, Dr. Donne, J. Sylvester, and others."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Who was the purchaser of this precious MS.? In this age of
  Shakspearian research, when every newly discovered relic is hailed with
  intense delight, may I inquire of some of your numerous readers, who seem
  to take as much delight as myself in whatever concerns our great
  dramatist and his writings, whether they can throw any light upon the

  <p>Again: "A peculiar interest," Mr. Collier says, "attaches to one of
  the pieces in John Dowland's <i>First Book of Songs</i> (p. 57.), on
  account of the initials of 'W.&nbsp;S.' being appended to it, in a manuscript
  of the time preserved in the Hamburgh City Library. It is inserted in
  <i>England's Helicon</i>, 4to., 1600, as from Dowland's <i>Book of
  Tablature</i>, without any name or initials; and looking at the character
  and language of the piece, it is at least not impossible that it was the
  work of our great dramatist, to whom it has been assigned by some
  continental critics. A copy of it was, many years ago, sent to the author
  by a German scholar of high reputation, under the conviction that the
  poem ought to be included in any future edition of the works of
  Shakspeare. It will be admitted that the lines are not unworthy of his
  pen; and, from the quality of other productions in the same musical work,
  we may perhaps speculate whether Shakspeare were not the writer of some
  other poems there inserted. If we were to take it for granted, that a
  sonnet in <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>, 1599, was by Shakspeare, because
  it is there attributed to him, we might be sure that he was a warm
  admirer of Dowland,</p>

  <p>However, it is more than likely, that the sonnet in which this passage
  is found was by Barnfield, and not by Shakspeare: it was printed by
  Barnfield in 1598, and reprinted by him in 1605, notwithstanding the
  intermediate appearance of it in <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>May I inquire if any new light has been thrown upon this disputed song
  since the publication of Mr. Collier's <i>Lyric Poems</i> in 1844?</p>

  <p>The song is addressed to Cynthia, and, as Mr. Collier says, is not
  unworthy of Shakspeare's muse. As it is not of any great length, perhaps
  it may be thought worthy of insertion in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Collier's "Notes and Emendations:" Passage in "All's Well that
  Ends Well."</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"O you leaden messengers,</p>
      <p>That ride upon the violent speed of fire,</p>
      <p>Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,</p>
      <p>That sings with piercing, do not touch my lord!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Such is the text of the first folio. <span class="sc">Mr. Payne
  Collier</span>, at p. 162. of his <i>Notes and Emendations</i>, informs
  us that the old corrector of his folio of 1632 reads <i>volant</i> for
  "violent," <i>wound</i> for "move," and <i>still-piecing</i> for
  "still-peering."</p>

  <p>Two of these substitutions are easily shown to be correct. In the
  <i>Tempest</i>, Act III. Sc. 3., we read:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10hg3">"The elements,</p>
      <p>Of whom your swords are tempered, may as well</p>
      <p><i>Wound the loud winds, or with bemockt-at stabs</i></p>
      <p><i>Kill the still-closing waters</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What is <i>still-closing</i> but <i>still-piecing</i>, the silent
  reunion after severance? What is to <i>wound the loud winds</i> but to
  <i>wound the air that sings with piercing</i>?</p>

  <p>But as to the third substitution, I beg permission through your pages
  to enter a <i>caveat</i>. If <!-- Page 427 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page427"></a>{427}</span>we had no proof from the text of
  Shakspeare that <i>violent</i> is the correct reading, I fancy that any
  reader's common sense would tell him that it is more an appropriate and
  trenchant term than <i>volant</i>. "What judgment would <i>stoop</i> from
  this to this?" <i>Volant</i>, moreover, is not English, but French, and
  as such is used in <i>Henry V.</i>; but happily, in this case, we have
  most abundant evidence from the text of Shakspeare that he wrote
  <i>violent</i> in the above passage. In <i>Henry VIII.</i>, Act I. Sc.
  1., we have the passage,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"We may outrun,</p>
      <p>By <i>violent swiftness</i>, that which we run at,</p>
      <p>And lose by over-running."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Othello</i>, Act III. Sc. 3., we have the passage,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Even so my bloody thoughts, with <i>violent pace</i>,</p>
      <p>Shall ne'er look back."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These passages prove that <i>violent</i> is a true Shakspearian
  epithet for <i>velocity</i>. But how exquisitely appropriate is the
  epithet when applied to the velocity of a ball issuing from the mouth of
  a cannon: and here we have full confirmation from <i>Romeo and
  Juliet</i>, Act V. Sc. 1., where we read:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"As <i>violently</i> as hasty powder fir'd</p>
      <p>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I trust that <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> will not, in the
  teeth of such evidence, substitute <i>volant</i> for <i>violent</i> in
  correcting the text of his forthcoming edition.</p>

<h3>GENERAL MONK AND THE UNIVERSITY OF
CAMBRIDGE.</h3>

  <p>A document has recently come into my possession which may perhaps be
  deemed worth preserving in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." It is a letter from
  the University of Cambridge to General Monk, and, from the various
  corrections which occur in it, it has every appearance of being the
  original draft. Unfortunately it is not dated; but there can, I presume,
  be little doubt of its having been written shortly before the assembling
  of the parliament in April, 1660, which led to the Restoration, and in
  which Monk sat as member for the county of Devon. The words erased in the
  original are here placed between parentheses, and those substituted are
  given in Italics:</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Curiosities of Railway Literature.</i>&mdash;Has "Bradshaw" had any
  reviewers? If not, an example or two from this neighbourhood, of the
  absurdities which reappear month after month in the time-tables, may show
  the necessity of them. A Midland train proposes to leave Gloucester at
  12.40 p.m., and reach Cheltenham at 1 p.m. The Great Western Company
  advertise an express train, on the <i>very same line</i>, to leave two
  minutes <i>later</i> and arrive five minutes <i>earlier</i>. It is
  therefore obvious, that if these trains were to keep their proper time,
  the express must run into the slow coach in front. The Great Western
  Railway Company have also, in a very unassuming manner, been advertising
  a feat hitherto unparalleled in the annals of railway speed,&mdash;the
  mail from Cheltenham at 8.20 a.m. to leave Gloucester at 8.27; that is to
  say, seven miles, including starting, slackening speed at two or three
  "crossings," stopping, starting again, all in seven minutes! Let the
  narrow gauge beat this if it can.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>JACOB BOBART AND HIS DRAGON, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Zachary Grey, in his edition of <i>Hudibras</i>, vol. i. p. 125.,
  relates the following anecdote:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Jacob Bobart, Botany Professor of Oxford, did, about forty years
  ago (in 1704), find a dead rat in the Physic Garden, which he made to
  resemble the common picture of dragons, by altering its head and tail,
  and thrusting in taper sharp sticks, which distended the skin on each
  side till it mimicked wings. He let it dry as hard as possible. The
  learned immediately pronounced it a dragon, and one of them sent an
  accurate description of it to Dr. Maliabechi, Librarian to the Grand Duke
  of Tuscany: <i>several fine copies of verses</i> were wrote upon so rare
  a subject, but at last Mr. Bobart owned the cheat: however, it was looked
  upon as a masterpiece of art, and as such deposited in the anatomy
  schools (at Oxford), where I saw it some years after."</p>

<h3>BISHOP BERKELEY'S PORTRAIT.</h3>

  <p>The following letter may perhaps have some interest in itself; but I
  send it for insertion in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." in the hope of
  obtaining some information about the pictures which it mentions. It is
  addressed on the back, "The Reverend the Provost and Fellows, Dublin
  College;" and in the corner, "Pr. Favour of The Right Hon. Lord Viscount
  Molesworth;" and does not appear to have ever passed through the
  post.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<blockquote class="b2n">

  <p>Reverend Sir, and Gentlemen,</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>My late dear Husband, the Rev. Dr. Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury,
  son of the late Lord Bishop of Cloyne, having most generously appointed
  me sole executrix of his will, and having bequeathed to me all his fine
  collection of pictures, &amp;c., I trouble you with this to beg to know
  whether a very remarkably fine, universally admired portrait of Bishop
  Berkeley, in his lawn sleeves, &amp;c., painted by that famous artist
  Vanderbank, which, together with its frame (now much broken by frequent
  removals), cost five hundred pounds: the back-ground, the frontispiece to
  his Lordship's <i>Minute Philosopher</i>, and the broken cisterns from
  the Prophet Jeremiah: "They have hewn them out broken cisterns." The late
  Archbishop of Canterbury was perpetually entreating Dr. Berkeley to
  present it to the Gallery of Lambeth Palace, where there is already a
  very good portrait of Bishop B.&mdash;But <i>justice</i> to my dear
  excellent son, then living, as Dr. B. told his Grace, precluded a
  <i>possibility</i> of his complying with his request.</p>

  <p>If this picture will be an acceptable present to the Rev. the Provost,
  and the Gentlemen Fellows of the University of Dublin, it is now offered
  for their acceptance, as a most grateful acknowledgment for the <i>very
  high</i> honour<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, they were pleased <!-- Page 429
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page429"></a>{429}</span>so graciously
  to confer on his Lordship's only descendant, the late learned
  accomplished George Monk Berkeley, Esq. (Gentleman Commoner of Magdalene
  Hall, in the University of Oxon., and student of the Inner Temple,
  London), from his very sincerely grateful mother.</p>

  <p>Some time after the death of his son, Dr. Berkeley told me that at my
  death he wished the wonderfully fine portrait of his father to be
  presented to some place of <i>consequence</i>. I immediately replied,
  "<i>To Dublin College</i>." He said, "They have one already; perhaps it
  would be well to leave it as an heir-loom to the Episcopal Palace at
  Cloyne." I said perhaps the gentlemen of Dublin College would prefer
  this, esteemed one of the very finest pieces of painting in Europe. The
  face certainly looks more like a fine cast in wax, than a painting on
  canvas, as numbers of the best judges have always exclaimed on seeing
  it.</p>

  <p>I request Dr. Berkeley's noble relation, the excellent Lord
  Molesworth, now on a visit in Ireland, to deliver this, and to learn from
  the Provost and Gentlemen of the University of Dublin, whether it would
  be agreeable to them to receive this, and transfer the one they at
  present have to Dr. Berkeley's highly respected friend, the
  <i>present</i> Bishop of Cloyne, for the Palace. Lord Molesworth will
  have the goodness to receive and transmit the answer of the Provost and
  Gentlemen to her who has the honour to subscribe herself, with the most
  perfect respect, their</p>

  <p>I cannot find any evidence to prove that this letter was ever so much
  as received by the University. It came into my possession amongst the
  papers of a private friend, a late distinguished ornament of the
  University, whose death has been an irreparable loss to the public, to
  the Church of England, and to a large circle of friends. No notice of
  such a letter, or of so liberal a donation, is to be found in the
  Register of the University, nor is there such a picture in our
  possession. I have made inquiry also, and find that it is not at Cloyne.
  The conclusion therefore is, either that Mrs. Berkeley changed her mind,
  or that from some accident the letter never was presented: at all events,
  it is certain that the picture of Bishop Berkeley, to which it relates,
  was never in the possession of the University for whose halls it was
  intended.</p>

  <p>Can any one tell me where it now is; and what was the fate of "the
  fine collection of pictures" which was the property of Dr. Berkeley of
  Canterbury, and bequeathed by him to his widow, the writer of the above
  letter?</p>

  <p><i>Optical Query.</i>&mdash;Last summer the following illusion was
  pointed out to me at Sandwich, Kent. The ingenious horizontal machine to
  enable the treadmill to grind the wind, in default of more substantial
  matter, although certainly revolving only in one direction, say from
  right to left, at intervals appeared to change its direction and turn
  from left to right. This change appeared to several persons to take place
  at the same time, and did not seem to be owing to any shifting of the
  perpendicular shutters for regulating the resistance of the air. The
  point from which I viewed it was near the south door of St. Clement's
  Church. Have any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." noticed a similar
  illusion, and can they explain it?</p>

  <p><i>Archbishop King.</i>&mdash;The well-known William King, Archbishop
  of Dublin, was interred in the graveyard of the parish of St. Mary,
  Donnybrook, near Dublin, as appears from the following entry in the
  Register of Burials: "Buried, Archbishop King, May 10th, 1729." There is
  no stone to mark his grave. I would be glad to know whether there is any
  monument elsewhere,</p>

  <p>I would likewise be glad to know whether there is any good engraving
  of the archbishop in existence. I have lately procured a copy of a small
  and rather curious one, engraved by "Kane o' Hara," and "published, Sept.
  20th, 1803, by William Richardson, York House, 31. Strand;" and I am
  informed by a friend that a portrait (of what size I am not aware) was
  sold by auction in London, 15th February, 1800, for the sum of 3<i>l.</i>
  6<i>s.</i> It was described at that time as "very rare."</p>

  <p>Donnybrook graveyard, I may add, is rich in buried ecclesiastics,
  containing the remains of Dr. Robert Clayton, Bishop of Clogher (a man of
  note in his day), and other dignitaries of our church.</p>

  <p><i>Whence the Word "Cossack?"</i>&mdash;Alison says, on the authority
  of <i>Koramsin</i> (vi. 476.), "The word Cossack means a volunteer or
  free partisan," &amp;c. (Vide <i>History of Europe</i>, vol. ix. p. 31.)
  I have found the word "Kasak" in the Gulistan of Saadi, which there means
  a robber of the kind called <i>rahzán</i>. From the word being spelt in
  the Gulistan with a <span lang="ar" title="q" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x642;</bdo></span>, it appears to me to be an Arabic word.

  <p><i>Picts' Houses and Argils.</i>&mdash;The Cimmerians, a people
  mentioned by Herodotus, who occupied principally the peninsula of the
  Crimea, are distinguished by Prichard from the Cimbri or Kimbri, but
  supposed by M. Amédée Thierry to be a branch of the same race, and
  Celtic. Many of their customs are said to present a striking conformity
  with those of the Cimbri of the Baltic and of the Gauls. Those who
  inhabited the hills in the Crimea bore the name of Taures or Tauri, a
  word, Thierry says, signifying mountaineers in both the Kimbric and
  Gaulish idioms. The tribe of the plains, according to Ephorus, a Greek
  writer cotemporary with Aristotle, mentioned in Strabo, lib. v., dug
  subterraneous habitations, which they called <i>argil</i> or
  <i>argel</i>, a pure Kimbric word, which signifies a covered or deep
  place:</p>

  <p>Having seen several of the rude and miserable buildings underground in
  the Orkneys, called Picts' houses, I should like to know something of
  these <i>argils</i> or <i>argillæ</i>, but suppose them to be calculated

  dwellers in Picts' houses. Perhaps some of your correspondents could give
  information on this matter. <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>The Drummer's Letter.</i>&mdash;The letter from the drummer to the
  corporal's wife in <i>The Sentimental Journey</i> (it is hardly possible
  to give a precise reference to any part of this little work) ends
  thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Je suis, Madame,</p>

  <p>Why is the first of the adjectives agreeing with <i>les sentimens</i>
  in the wrong gender? The blot may be a trifling one, but I think I may
  say that it defaces every copy of this well-known billet-doux. I have
  seen many editions of <i>The Sentimental Journey</i>, some by the best
  publishers of the time in which they lived, and I find the same mistake
  in all: I do not know of a single exception. If Sterne wrote
  <i>toutes</i>, it must have been by accident; there is nothing to prove
  that he wished to make the poor drummer commit the solecism, for the rest
  of his letter is not only correctly, but even elegantly written.</p>

  <p class="address">Merchant Taylors'.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[It was Dr. John Hartcliffe, of Merchant Taylors', that wished to
  become Provost of King's College: but the mandate was obtained from King
  William, not from James II. Hartcliffe's <i>Discourse against
  Purgatory</i>, 1685, which Anthony à Wood thinks was publicly burnt in
  France, was not likely to recommend him to the favour of the latter king.
  The affair of the Provostship is thus stated by Cole (<i>Hist. of King's
  College</i>, vol. iv. Addit. MSS. 5817.)&mdash;"On the death of Dr.
  Copleston, Hartcliffe made a great stir, in order to become Provost, and
  actually obtained a mandate of King William to the society to choose him;
  but he was far from being agreeable to the Fellows of the college, who,
  when they heard he was in town, and upon what errand he came, directly
  shut up the college gates, and proceeded to an election, when Dr.
  Roderick was chosen, with the odds of ten votes to one. This being
  transacted in the infancy of King William's reign, he chose not to stir
  much in it; but after having shown the Fellows, by the very petition they
  made to him, which was presented by Mr. Newborough and Mr. Fleetwood,
  that he had a right to present, he dismissed them." A biographical notice
  of Dr. Hartcliffe is given in Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol.
  i. pp. 63, 64., and in Wood's <i>Athenæ</i> (Bliss), vol. iv. p. 790.</p>

  <p>No one appears to have continued Ward's <i>Lives of the Gresham
  Professors</i>. Maitland, in his <i>History of London</i>, has brought
  the history of the institution down to 1755. Dr. Ward himself had
  prepared a new edition, containing considerable additions, which was
  presented to the British Museum by his residuary legatee. Among the
  Additional MSS. also will be found a large mass of papers and
  correspondence relating to the <i>Lives</i>. From one document, entitled
  "Minutes relating to the Lives of the Professors of Gresham College,
  being Additions to the printed Work," we extract the following notice of
  "William Cokayne, who was the son of George Cokayne, of Dovebridge in
  Devonshire, clerk. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, in
  London, and from thence elected probationer Fellow of St. John's College,
  where he was matriculated 9th July, 1736. He commenced A.M. 9th July,
  1744; made Junior Proctor 1750; and B.D. 4th July, 1751." The date of his
  appointment as Astronomy Professor is not given; but his resignation, in
  1795, will be found in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. lxv. p. 711.
  He appears to have died in 1798 (see <i>Ib.</i>, vol. lxviii. p. 641.),
  when the Rev. Joseph Monkhouse succeeded him as Rector of Kilkhampton,
  co. Cornwall.</p>

<p><!-- Page 432 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>{432}</span></p>

  <p>The MS. "Minutes" also contain a notice of William Roman, the
  thirteenth Geometry Professor, "who was educated at Merchant Taylors'
  School, London, and from thence elected to St. John's College, Oxford, in
  1740, being matriculated as the son of Richard Roman, of London, Gent.,
  ætat. 17. He commenced B.C.L., May 5th, 1747; Deacon at Christ Church,
  21st Sept., 1746; Priest at Christ Church, 20th Sept., 1747." No date of
  his appointment, but he was Professor in 1755, when Maitland wrote his
  account of the college. Dr. Samuel Kettilby succeeded the Rev. Samuel
  Birch as Geometry Lecturer, and died June 25, 1808.&mdash;See

<h3>THE LEGEND OF LAMECH&mdash;HEBREW ETYMOLOGY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 363.)</p>

  <p>Etymologists are a race who frequently need to be drawn up with a
  somewhat tight rein. Our Celtic fellow-subjects will not, perhaps, be
  much gratified by <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span>'s tracing the
  first indications of their paternal tongue to the family of Cain; and as
  every branch of that family was destroyed by the deluge, they may marvel
  what account he can give of its reconstruction amongst their forefathers.
  But as his manner of expressing himself may lead some of your readers to
  imagine that he is explaining Cain, Lamech, Adah, Zillah, from
  acknowledged Hebrew meanings of any parts of those words, it may be as
  well to warn them that the Hebrew gives no support to any one of his
  interpretations. If fancy be ductile enough to agree with him in seeing a
  representation of a human arm holding a sling with a stone in it in the
  Hebrew letter called <i>lamed</i>, there would still be a broad hiatus
  between such a concession, and the conclusion he seems to wish the reader
  to draw from it, viz. that the word <i>lamed</i> must have something to
  do with slinging, and that consequently <i>lamed</i> must be a slinger.
  The Hebrew scholar knows that <i>lamed</i> indisputably signifies to
  <i>teach</i>; and though perhaps he may not feel sure that the Hebrew
  consonant <i>l</i> obtained its name from any connexion with that primary
  meaning of the root <i>lamed</i>, he will not think it improbable that as
  the letter <i>l</i>, when prefixed to a noun or verb, <i>teaches</i> the
  reader the construction of the sentence, that may have been the reason
  for its being so named.</p>

  <p>As to a legend not traceable to within some thousand years of the
  facts with which it claims to be connected, those may take an interest in
  it who like so to do. But as far as we may regard Lamech's address to his
  wives in the light of a philological curiosity, it is interesting to
  observe how naturally the language of passion runs into poetry; and that
  this, the most ancient poetry in existence, is in strict unison with the
  peculiar character of subsequent Hebrew poetry; that peculiarity
  consisting of the repetition of clauses, containing either the same
  proposition in a slightly different form, or its antithesis; a rhyme of
  thoughts, if we may so say, instead of a rhyme of sounds, and
  consequently capable of being preserved by a literal translation.</p>

  <p>And Lamech said unto his wives,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;</p>
      <p>Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech,</p>
      <p>For I have slain a man to my wounding,</p>
      <p>And a young man, to my hurt.</p>
      <p>If Cain shall be avenged seventy-fold,</p>
      <p>Truly Lamech, seventy and seven-fold."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The construction is more favourable to the belief that the <i>man</i>
  of line third is the same as the <i>young man</i> of the parallel clause,
  than that he had slain two; the word rendered <i>hurt</i> is properly a
  <i>wheal</i>, the effect of a severe strife or wound.</p>

  <p>As to the etymologies of the names mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Crossley</span>, we gather from God's words that she called her first son
  Cain, an acquisition (the Latin <i>peculium</i> expresses it more exactly
  than any English word), because she had gotten (literally
  <i>acquired</i>, or obtained possession of) a man. As for Lamech, or more
  properly L&#x115;m&#x115;ch, its etymology must be confessed to be
  uncertain; but there is a curious and interesting explanation of the
  whole series of names of the patriarchs, Noah's forefathers, in which the
  name of the other Lemech, son of Methusaleh, is regarded as made up of
  <i>L&#x115;</i>, the prefixed preposition, and of <i>mech</i>, taken for
  the participle Hophal of the verb to smite or bruise. Adah, <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="'DH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D3;&#x5D4;</bdo></span>, is <i>ornament</i>; Zillah,
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="TSLH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E6;&#x5DC;&#x5D4;</bdo></span> may mean the <i>shade</i>
  under which a person reposes; or if the doubling of the <i>l</i> is an
  indication that its root is <span lang="he" class="heb" title="TSLL"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E6;&#x5DC;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>, it may mean a
  dancer.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. Walter.</span></p>

  <p>Allow me, in reference to <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span>'s
  remarks, to say, that from the accidental resemblance of the Hebrew and
  Celtic words <i>Lamech</i> and <i>Lamaich</i>, no philological argument
  can be drawn of identical meaning, any more than from the fact that the
  words Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazar, or Belteshassar<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, are significant in Russian <!--
  Page 433 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page433"></a>{433}</span>and
  Sclavonian, as well as in Chaldee. <i>Lamache</i> in Arabic means (see
  Freytag) "<i>levi intuitu et furtim adspicere</i> aliquem;" also to
  <i>shine</i>, as lightning, or a star. <i>Lamech</i>, therefore, is an
  appropriate designation for a man known to prowl about for plunder and
  murder, and whose eye, whether taking aim or not, would give a sudden and
  furtive glance.</p>

  <p>The word <i>lamed</i> signifies, in Hebrew, <i>teaching</i>; the word
  <i>Talmud</i> is from the same root. It is the same in Syriac and
  Chaldee. The <i>original</i> significant of these three languages is to
  be found in the Arabic <i>Lamada</i>: "<i>Se submisit</i> alicui;
  <i>humiliter se gessit</i> erga aliquem." (Freytag.) No argument can be
  drawn from the shape of the letter <span lang="he" class="heb" title="L"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DC;</bdo></span> (<i>lamed</i>), because, although
  popularly so called, it is <i>not</i> a Hebrew letter, but a Chaldee one.
  The recent discoveries, published in Layard's last work, demonstrate this
  fact; Mr. Layard falls into the mistake of calling the basin inscriptions
  Hebrew, although Mr. Ellis, who had translated them, says expressly that
  the language is Chaldee (<i>Nineveh and Babylon</i>, p. 510.), one of
  them only being Syriac (p. 521.). Chaldee and Syriac, indeed, differ from
  each other as little as Chaucer's and Shakspeare's English, although the
  written characters are wholly distinct.</p>

  <p>Davis, in his <i>Celtic Researches</i>, has done all that was
  possible, taking a very limited view, however, in fixing upon certain
  linguistic resemblances in some ancient tongues to the Celtic; but a
  clear apprehension of the proper place which the Celtic language and its
  congeners hold in comparative philology, can only be learnt from such
  works as Adelung's <i>Mithridates</i>, and Adrien Balbi's <i>Atlas
  Ethnographique du Globe</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">T. J. Buckton.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote2"></a><b>Footnote 2:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag2">(return)</a>
  <p>The accidental resemblances are curious. Thus, <i>Nebucadnetzar</i> is
  in Russian <i>nebê kazenniy Tzar</i>, "A Lord or Prince appointed by
  heaven;" or, <i>nebu godnoi</i> <i>Tzar</i>, "A Prince fit for heaven."
  <i>Belshatzar</i> is also in Russian <i>bolszoi Tzar</i>, "A great
  Prince;" and <i>Belteshtzar</i>, Daniel's Chaldean pagan name, is <i>byl
  têsh Tzar</i>, "he was also a Prince," <i>i. e.</i> "of the royal
  family."</p>

</div>
  <p>The interpretation of Hessius (<i>Geschichte der Patriarchen</i>, i.
  83.) is preferred by Rosenmüller:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ex hujus Doctissimi Viri sententia Lamechus <i>sese jactat</i>
  propter filios suos, qui artium adeo utilium essent inventores: Cainum
  progenitorem suum propter cædem non esse punitum, multo minus se posse
  puniri, si vel simile scelus commisisset. Verba enim non significant,
  cædam ab eo revera esse paratam, sed sunt verba hominis admodum
  insolentis et profani. Ceterum facile apparet, hæc verba a Mose ex quodam
  carmine antiquo inserta esse: tota enim oratio poeticam quandam
  sublimitatem spirat."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The sense of these two verses (Gen. iv. 23, 24.) is, according to
  Dathe:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Si propter viri aut juvenis cædem vulnera et plagæ mihi
  intendantur, cum de Caino p&oelig;na septuplex statuta fuerit, in Lamecho
  id fiet septuagies septies.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Herder, in his <i>Geist der ebräischen Poesie</i> (i. 344.) says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Carmen hoc Lamechi laudes canere gladii a filio inventi, cujus usum
  et præstantiam contra hostiles aliorum insultus his verbis prædicet:
  <i>Lamechi mulieres audite sermonem meum, percipite dicta mea: Occido jam
  virum, qui me vulneravit, juvenem, qui plagam mihi infligit. Si Cainus

<h3>LORD COKE'S CHARGE TO THE JURY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 376.)</p>

  <p><i>Saltpetre-man.</i>&mdash;An explanation of this title may be found
  in a proclamation of King Charles I. (1625):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For the Maintaining and Increasing of the Saltpetre Mines of England,
  for the Necessary and Important Manufacture of Gunpowder."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This proclamation states:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That our realm naturally yields sufficient mines of saltpetre without
  depending on foreign parts; wherefore, for the future, no dovehouse shall
  be paved with stones, bricks, nor boards, lime, sand, nor gravel, nor any
  other thing whereby the growth and increase of the mine and saltpetre may
  be hindered or impaired; but the proprietors shall suffer the ground or
  floors thereof, as also all stables where horses stand, to lie open with
  good and mellow earth, apt to breed increase of the said mine. And that
  none deny or hinder any <i>saltpetre-man</i>, lawfully deputed thereto,
  from digging, taking, or working any ground which by commission may be
  taken and wrought for saltpetre. Neither shall any constable, or other
  officer, neglect to furnish any such <i>saltpetre-man</i> with convenient
  carriages, that the King's service suffer not. <i>None shall bribe any
  saltpetre-man</i> for the sparing or forbearing of any ground fit to be
  wrought for saltpetre," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would appear that the <i>saltpetre-man</i> abused his authority,
  and that the people suffered a good deal of annoyance from the manner in
  which this <!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page434"></a>{434}</span>absurd system was carried out; for two
  years afterwards we find that another proclamation was published by the
  King, notifying, "that the practice of making saltpetre in England by
  digging up the floors of dwelling-houses, &amp;c. &amp;c., tended too
  much to the grievance of his loving subjects ... that notwithstanding all
  the trouble, not one third part of the saltpetre required could be
  furnished." It proceeds to state that Sir John Brooke and Thomas Russell,
  Esq., had proposed a new method of manufacturing the article, and that an
  exclusive patent had been granted to them. The King then <i>commands</i>
  his subjects in London and Westminster, that after notice given, they
  "carefully keep in proper vessels all human urine throughout the year,
  and as much of that of beasts as can be saved." This appeared to fail;
  for at the end of the same year, the "stable" monarch proclaimed a return
  to the old method, giving a commission to the Duke of Buckingham, and
  some others, to "... break open ... and work for saltpetre," as might be
  found requisite; and in 1634, a further proclamation was issued renewing
  the old ones, but excepting the houses, stables, &amp;c. of <i>persons of
  quality</i>.</p>

  <p>During the Commonwealth the nuisance was finally got rid of; for an
  act was passed in 1656, directing that "none shall dig within the houses,
  &amp;c. of any person <i>without their leave first obtained</i>."</p>

  <p>"And little do I esteem an uncharitable and malicious practice in

  of Norwich, 4th August, 1606, which I protest was not only published
  without my privity, but (beside the omission of divers principal matters)
  that there is no one period therein expressed in that sort and sense that
  I delivered: wherein it is worthy of observation, how their expectation
  (of scandalizing me) was wholly deceived; for behold the catastrophe!

  that <i>inimicus et iniquus homo superseminavit zizania in medio

  reason, found out the same conclusion, both in respect of the vanity of
  the phrase, and for that I, publishing about the same time one of my

  matter, have done it myself, and not to have suffered any of my works
  pass under the name of Pricket; and so <i>unâ voce conclamaverunt

  thereof to be a wicked and malicious falsary."</p>

<h3>WHITE ROSES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 329.)</p>

  <p>The allusion is to the well-known Jacobite badge of the white rose,
  which was regularly worn on June 10, the anniversary of the Old
  Pretender's birthday, by his adherents. Fielding refers to the custom in
  his <i>Amelia</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the lovely 10th of June, under a serene sky, the amorous Jacobite,
  kissing the odoriferous Zephyr's breath, gathers a nosegay of white roses

<h3>BURIAL OF UNCLAIMED CORPSE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 262. 340.)</p>

  <p>A tradition of similar character with that mentioned by E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R., and
  noticed by J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;L., is reported to have occurred between the parishes of
  Shipdham and Saham Tony in Norfolk, of a corpse being found on the common
  pasture of Shipdham, which parish refused to bury it, and the parish of
  Saham Tony, therefore, was at the expense thereof, and claimed a
  considerable piece of the common pasture from Shipdham, in consequence of
  the neglect of the latter parish.</p>

  <p>A fine continues to be paid by Shipdham to Saham to this time; and
  although many entries are made of such payments in the early parish
  accounts, beginning <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1511, yet in no
  instance is it said the reason or cause of these payments being annually
  made. The said payments are not always of the same amount; they are
  sometimes paid in money and sometimes in kind, as the following instances
  show.</p>

  <p>The first entry I meet with is in 1511:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">Payd the halffe mark at Saham.</p>
      <p>1512.  Delyvyrd to same ij buschells of otts, viij<sup>d</sup>; in sylv<sup>r</sup>, ij<sup>d</sup>.</p>
      <p>1513.  The same payment as in 1512.</p>
      <p>1514.  No entry of any payment.</p>
      <p>1515.  Payd for <i>woots</i> to Saham, vj<sup>d</sup>, and ij<sup>d</sup> of mony.</p>
      <p>1516.  Payd to y<sup>e</sup> hallemarke, j<sup>d</sup> (not said if to Saham or not).</p>
      <p class="i4">This entry "to y<sup>e</sup> hallemark" may be an error of the scribe for "y<sup>e</sup> halffe mark," as in the first entry under 1511.</p>
      <p>1517.  Payd to y<sup>e</sup> halffe mark, j<sup>d</sup> (no doubt to Saham).</p>
      <p>1518.  No entry of payment to Saham.</p>
      <p>1519.  Payd to same for ij barssels of owte, vj<sup>d</sup>; to same, ij<sup>d</sup> ... viij<sup>d</sup></p>

      <p>1524.  Payd for otts to sam and wodlod  ...  viij<sup>d</sup></p>
      <p>1525.  Similar entry to the last.</p>
      <p>1526.  Payd for otts to same, viij<sup>d</sup>; payd for wod led to same, j<sup>d</sup>  ...  ix<sup>d</sup></p>
      <p>1527.  Payd the halffe mark, j<sup>d</sup>; paid to the <i>Comon</i>, to (two) bussells otts, ix<sup>d</sup>, and</p>

      <p class="i4">Payd to y<sup>e</sup> seyd Thomas for j heyn (hen) to Saham ... ij<sup>d</sup></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On looking through the town accounts of Shipdham, I find entries
  of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Payd to the half mark to Saham                j<sup>d</sup></p>
      <p>Ij bushells oates, and in lieu of a hen      ij<sup>d</sup></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The only entry in which I find anything at all apparently relative to
  the common is that under 1527. Whether the court books of Saham would
  throw any light on the subject, I know not. Should an opportunity offer
  for my searching them, I will do so.</p>

  <p class="author">G. H. I.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Although I have given several entries of the customary
  payments to Saham, they are merely given to show the different modes of
  making those entries, and not in expectation of your giving all of them,
  unless you think any further light can be given on the subject. As
  before, perhaps the court books of the manor of Saham would assist.</p>

  <p>It was an annual custom for Shipdham people to "Drive the common" (as
  it was called) once a year, in a night of an uncertain time, when all the
  cattle, &amp;c. found within the limits or boundary of Shipdham were
  impounded in a farm-yard adjoining. Upon the common, all those belonging
  to owners residing in Shipdham and claimed were set at liberty, while
  those belonging to Saham had to be replevied by a small payment, which
  custom continued up to the period of the commons being inclosed. Perhaps
  this custom was by way of retaliation, by which means the charge of
  payment of oats and a hen was recovered by the money paid for replevying
  their cattle, &amp;c. so impounded.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote3"></a><b>Footnote 3:</b><a

  <p>No payment entered in the accounts between 1527 and 1539. The average
  tenpence annually.</p>

<h3>PSALMANAZAR.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 206.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent inquires as to the real name of this most penitent
  of impostors. I fear that <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page436"></a>{436}</span>there is now no likelihood of its being
  discovered. His most intimate friends appear to have been kept in the
  dark on this subject. With respect to his country, the most probable
  conclusion seems to be, that he was born in the south of Europe, in a
  city of Languedoc. A very near approximation seems to be made to the
  exact locality by a careful collation of the circumstances mentioned in
  his autobiography, in the excellent summary of his life in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vols. xxxiv. and xxxv., which is much better
  worth consulting than the articles in Aikin or Chalmers; which are poor
  and superficial, and neither of which gives any list of his works, or
  notices the <i>Essay on Miracles, by a Layman</i> (London, 1753, 8vo.),
  which is one of them, though published anonymously. There is a very
  amusing account of conversations with him at Oxford, in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. xxxv. p. 78., in which, before a large
  company of ladies and gentlemen who were curious as to the customs of
  Formosa, he gravely defended the practice which he said existed in that
  country, of cutting off the heads of their wives and eating them, in case
  of misconduct. "I think it is no sin," continued he, "to eat human flesh,
  but I must own it is a little unmannerly." He admitted that he once ate
  part of a black; but they being always kept to hard work, their flesh was
  tough and unsavoury. His grandfather, he said, lived to 117, and was as
  vigorous as a young man, in consequence of sucking the blood of a viper
  warm every morning; but they had been forced to kill him, he being
  attacked with a violent fit of the colic, and desiring them to stab him,
  which, in obedience to another "custom of the country," they had done.
  <i>Splendidè mendax!</i> was certainly, in his younger days, this much
  venerated friend of our great moralist. I should, however, feel inclined
  to forgive much of his extraordinary romancing for the admirable manner
  in which he settled that chattering twaddler, Bishop Burnet:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was one day with Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Sarum, who, after his warm
  manner, cried, 'Ay, you say so; but what proof can you give that you are
  not of China, Japan, or any other country?' 'The manner of my flight,'
  replied he, 'did not allow me to bring credentials: but suppose your
  lordship were in Formosa, and should say you are an Englishman, might not
  the Formosan as justly reply, You say you are an Englishman; but what
  proof can you give that you are not of any other country? for you look as
  like a Dutchman as any that ever traded to Formosa.' This silenced his
  lordship."</p>

<h3>GRAFTS AND THE PARENT TREE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 365.)</p>

  <p>I was surprised to find it stated as "a fact" by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Ingleby</span>, "that grafts, after some fifteen years, wear themselves
  out." A visit to one of the great orchard counties would assure him of
  the existence of tens of thousands of grafted apple and pear trees, still
  in a healthy state, and from forty to fifty years old, and more. There
  are grafted trees of various kinds in this country, which to my own
  knowledge are upwards of sixty years old; and I have little doubt but
  that there are some a good deal older.</p>

  <p>The ancient Ribstone pippin, which stood in Ribstone Park, till it
  died in 1835, was believed to have been grafted. Such was the opinion of
  one of the gardeners there; and a writer in the <i>Gardeners'
  Chronicle</i>, 1845, p. 21., states that in 1830 he fell in with the
  Ribstone pippin in great abundance in Switzerland, in the valley of
  Sarnen; and he remarks that it is more probable this apple was introduced
  into England from that country, than the reverse. The question has not
  been conclusively settled.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding "the belief that the graft perishes when the parent
  tree decays" is pronounced by <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> to be a
  fond superstition, yet there are certain facts, well known to orchard
  growers, which give some warrant for it. Without committing myself
  altogether to this doctrine, I will state a few of them.</p>

  <p>It is well known that no cider or perry fruit is so good, on first
  being introduced, as it is after fifteen or twenty years of cultivation.
  A certain period seems to be required to mature the new sort, and bring
  it to its full vigour (long after it is in full bearing) before it is at
  its best. The tree, with all its grafted progeny, will last, perhaps
  fifty, perhaps more than one hundred years, in a flourishing state, and
  then they will begin everywhere to decay; nor has any device yet been
  successful in arresting that general decay.</p>

  <p>Witness the rise, progress, and fall of the <i>Forest Stire</i> of
  Gloucestershire, the <i>Foxwhelp</i> and <i>Redstreak</i> of
  Herefordshire, the <i>Golden Pippin</i>, and, more lately, the
  <i>Ribstone Pippin</i>, of which there is an increasing complaint, not to
  mention many others in the same condition. The first-named apple is very
  nearly extinct, and the small quantity of the fruit that is still to be
  had fetches enormous prices.</p>

  <p>Whether this decay be owing to <i>grafting</i>, is a question which
  can be decided only by the future behaviour of the suckers from the
  original tree, several of which from the tree at Ribstone Park are now
  growing at Chiswick and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>I am aware that Dr. Lindley combats very eagerly the doctrine that
  varieties of the apple and pear, or indeed of any tree, die naturally of
  old age; but the only incontrovertible fact which he adduces in support
  of his argument, is the existence of the French <i>White Beurré</i> pear,
  which has flourished from time immemorial. His denial of the decay of the
  <i>Golden Pippin</i>, the <i>Golden <!-- Page 437 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page437"></a>{437}</span>Harvey</i>, and the
  <i>Nonpareil</i>, will not, I think, be allowed to be just by the
  experience of your readers; the existence of the last-named apple for
  three centuries, supposing it to be true, has not secured it exemption
  from the general fate.</p>

<h2>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

  <p><i>Glass Baths.</i>&mdash;Several of your correspondents finding a
  difficulty in making glass baths, I beg to communicate the way in which
  they may be very easily manufactured. Having obtained two pieces of
  patent plate glass, grind the edges, which may readily be done by a
  scythe sand-stone, where other contrivances are not handy. Cut for the
  bottom of the bath a slip of the same glass three-quarters of an inch in
  breadth; and for the sides, from ordinary window-glass, four wedges,
  being about three-fifths of an inch at one end, tapering down to the
  thickness of the piece of plate glass at the bottom. If several pieces
  are cut off promiscuously, four may be selected which have exactly the
  same angle, so as to form an even support to the sides. The glass being
  perfectly clean, dry, and as warm as can be conveniently held by the
  hand, fix the bottom and then the sides by means of the <i>very best</i>
  sealing-wax, which will perfectly adhere to the glass. If the commoner
  sorts of wax are used, some marine glue must be added to it to temper it.
  The side slips should be fixed a quarter of an inch apart, so as to form
  a cavity, which must be entirely filled up with wax. The wax may be used
  as in sealing a letter in the first instance; but, in order to give the
  whole bath solidity, and expel every particle of air from between the
  glass, I use a heated pointed iron, as a plumber does in the act of
  soldering. This, passed over the external parts of the wax, also gives it
  a hardness and smooth finish.</p>

  <p>These details may appeal trifling, and others may have more ingenious
  modes of accomplishing the object; but having used baths so constructed
  upwards of twelve months without leakage, I believe they will be found to
  be most economical, and far more to be relied on than gutta percha. A
  good bath so made should require about six ounces of solution of nitrate
  of silver to take a picture eight inches square. Your observations in a
  former Number, respecting the uncertainty of gutta percha, I have found
  to be perfectly true. Samples of gutta percha constantly vary; and one
  may contain impurities acted upon by the chemicals, which another does
  not. A small rim formed by sealing-wax dissolved in spirits of wine, and
  applied twice or thrice along the upper edge of the bath, is sufficient
  to protect the prepared glass from adhering to the front of the bath when
  in use.</p>

  <p><i>Securing Calotype Negatives.</i>&mdash;Will any of your

  use hyposulph., with its consequent washings, &amp;c.? Some, I believe,
  recommend bromide of potassium; some, the iodide; others, common salt:
  but I should like to know which is considered the <i>best</i>; what
  strength, and how applied. Also, whether any subsequent treatment is
  necessary previous to the final application of the hypo.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Wood of the Cross</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 177. 334.).&mdash;I find, in
  your 179th Number, p. 334., a communication on "The Wood of the Cross."
  Mention is made of the several kinds of wood of which the cross is said
  to have been made&mdash;elder, olive, &amp;c. It is a somewhat curious
  coincidence, that yesterday I was with a farmer in his garden, and
  observing on several apple-trees some luxuriant mistletoe, I remarked
  that it was principally found on that tree, sometimes on the oak, but
  rarely on other trees. The farmer, after inquiring whether it could be
  propagated by cuttings, &amp;c., asked if I had ever understood that our
  Saviour's cross was made of mistletoe? On replying in the negative, and
  remarking that it was altogether unsuitable for such a purpose, he
  rejoined, that, previously to that event, it was a large strong tree, but
  subsequently had been doomed to have only a parasitical (not that he used
  the term) existence.</p>

  <p>As <span class="sc">Ceyrep</span> said "I never heard of our Lord's
  cross having been made of elder wood," so I would also add, I never heard
  before of its being made of mistletoe. Did any one else ever hear of this
  tradition?</p>

  <p><i>Bishops' Lawn Sleeves</i> (Vol. vi., p. 271.).&mdash;J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;T. has
  inquired concerning the date and origin of the present robes of Anglican
  bishops. Mr. Trevor thus describes the bishop's dress in Convocation,
  which is the proper dress of the episcopate:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The chimere is the Convocation habit of a doctor of divinity in
  Oxford, made of silk instead of cloth, as the rochet is an alb of lawn in
  place of linen, <i>honoris causâ</i>: the detaching the sleeves from the
  rochet, and sewing them to the upper garment instead, is obviously a
  contrivance of the robe-makers. Dr. Hody says that the scarlet robe worn
  by the bishops in the House of Lords is the doctor's gown at Cambridge;
  the first archbishops after the Reformation being of that university.
  (<i>Hody</i>, 140.) At Parker's consecration he appeared first in a
  scarlet gown and hood; then at the Holy Communion he and two of the
  consecrating bishops <!-- Page 438 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page438"></a>{438}</span>wore white surplices, while the senior had
  a cope: and after his consecration he and the two diocesan bishops endued
  themselves in the now customary dress of a bishop, the archbishop having
  about his neck a collar of sables (<i>Cardw. Doc. Ann.</i>, i. 243.).
  Before the Reformation, it was remarked as peculiar to the English
  bishops, that they always wore their white rochets, 'except when
  hunting.' (<i>Hody</i>, 141.)"&mdash;<i>The Two Convocations, Note

  <p><i>Parochial Libraries</i> (Vol. vi., p. 432.; Vol. vii., pp. 193.
  369.).&mdash;Upon visiting Cartmel in Lancashire ten years ago, I found a
  library in the vestry, and in my diary made the following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is a small library in the vestry, of a very miscellaneous
  description, left by a former incumbent, two hundred years ago, to the
  vicar for the time being, to be kept in the vestry. There is a fine copy,
  in small quarto, of Spenser's <i>Faery Queene</i> in the collection, of
  the date 1560."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>How I ascertained the date of the gift, or whether there were any
  other particulars worth recording, I do not remember. Since taking "N.
  &amp; Q." I have learnt the benefit, I might say the necessity, of being
  more particular.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Brick.</span></p>

  <p>To your list of parochial libraries may be added one in Swaffham
  Church, Norfolk, bequeathed to the parish by one of the Spelman family.
  It contains several hundred volumes, and among them some of the Elzevir
  classics. About seven years ago I visited Swaffham, and found this
  collection of books in a most disgraceful state, covered with dust and
  the dung of mice and bats, and many of the books torn from their
  bindings. It would afford me great pleasure to hear that more care is
  taken of such a valuable collection of books. There is also a smaller
  library, in somewhat better preservation, in the vestry of St. Peter's,
  Mancroft Church, in the city of Norwich.</p>

  <p><i>Huet's Navigations of Solomon</i> (Vol. vii., p. 381.).&mdash;In
  reply to <span class="sc">Edina's</span> Query, Huet's treatise <i>De
  Navigationibus Salomonis</i> was published in 1698, 12mo., at Amsterdam,
  and before his work on the Commerce of the Ancients was printed. <span
  class="sc">Edina</span> will find a short extract of its contents in vol.
  ii. p. 479. of Dr. Aikin's <i>Translation of Huet's Autobiography</i>,
  published in 1810 in two volumes 8vo. The subject is a curious and
  interesting one; but, from my perusal of the tract, I should scarcely say
  that Huet has treated it very successfully, or that the book is at all
  worthy of his learning or acuteness.</p>

  <p><i>Derby Municipal Seal</i> (Vol. vii., p. 357.).&mdash;The "buck in

  the name of that place, anciently <i>Deora-by</i> or <i>Deor-by</i>, i.

  founded St. Anne's College in Wells, for the maintenance of Societas

  <i>annuellar</i> was a secular conduct, receiving a yearly stipend. These

  <p><i>Reverend Richard Midgley, Vicar of Rochdale</i> (Vol. vii., p.

  Whitaker refers, as containing a very interesting account of Midgley,
  will undoubtedly be Samuel Clarke's <i>Lives of Thirty-two English
  Divines</i>. The passage, which will scarcely be new to your
  correspondent, is at p. 68. of the life of "Master Richard Rothwell"
  (Clarkes's <i>Lives</i>, edit. 1677, fol.), and a very pleasing passage
  it is, and one that I might almost <!-- Page 439 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page439"></a>{439}</span>be justified in
  extracting. Dr. Whitaker and Brook (<i>Lives of the Puritans</i>, vol.
  ii. p. 163.) seem to be at variance with regard to the Midgleys, the
  former mentioning only one, and the latter two, vicars of the family.</p>

  illustrative of this term. In Act I. Sc. 1., <i>Dash</i> describes the

  <p><i>Canongate Marriages</i> (Vol. v., p. 320.; Vol. vii., p.
  67.).&mdash;The correspondent who expressed his surprise some time ago at
  his Query on this subject not having called forth any remark from your
  Scotch friends, will perhaps find the explanation of this result in the
  fact, that in Scotland we are guided by the civil or Roman law on the
  subject of marriage; and consequently, with us marriage is altogether a
  civil contract; and we need the intervention neither of clergyman, Gretna
  blacksmith, or the equally disreputable Canongate coupler. The services
  of the last two individuals are only sought for by you deluded southerns.
  All we require here is the agreement or consent of the parties
  ("<i>consensus non</i> concubitus facit matrimonium"); and the legal
  questions which arise have reference chiefly to the evidence of this
  consent. The agreement may be made verbally, or in writing, before
  witnesses or not, as the parties choose. Or a marriage may be constituted
  and proved merely by habit and repute, <i>i. e.</i> by the parties living
  together as man and wife, and the man allowing the woman to be addressed
  as his wife. A promise of marriage, followed by <i>copula</i>, also
  constitutes a marriage. But it would be out of place here to enter into
  all the arcana of the Scotch law of marriage: suffice it to say, that it
  prevails equally at John o' Groat's House and Aberdeen, as in the
  Canongate or at Gretna Green. A <i>regular</i> marriage requires certain
  formalities, such as the publication of banns, &amp;c. An
  <i>irregular</i> one is equally good in law, and may be contracted in
  various ways, as above explained.</p>

  <p>This law, though <i>at first sight</i> likely to lead to great abuses,
  really works well in practice; and prevents the occurrence of those
  distressing cases, which not unfrequently happen in England, of seduction
  under promise of marriage, and subsequent desertion.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Scotus.</span></p>

  <p><i>Smock Marriages</i> (Vol. vii., p. 191.).&mdash;According to Scotch
  law, the marriage of the father and mother legitimises all children
  <i>previously</i> born, however old they may be. This is called
  legitimisation <i>per subsequens matrimonium</i>, and is not unfrequently
  taken advantage of by elderly gentlemen, who, after having passed the
  heyday of youth, wish to give their children a position, and a legal
  right to inherit their property. Like the rule as to marriage above
  explained, it is derived from the Roman or civil law. There are very few,
  I should rather say <i>no</i>, legal fictions in the Scotch law of the
  nature alluded to by your correspondent.</p>

  <p><i>Sculptured Emaciated Figures</i> (Vol. v., p 497.; Vol. vi.
  <i>passim</i>).&mdash;In Dickinson's <i>Antiquities of
  Nottinghamshire</i>, vol. i. p. 171., is a notice with an engraving of a
  tomb in Holme Church, near Southwell, bearing a sculptured emaciated
  figure of a youth evidently in the last stage of consumption, round which
  is this inscription: "Miseremini mei, miseremini mei, saltem vos amici
  mei, quia manus Domini tetigit me."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. P., Jun.</span></p>

  <p><i>Do the Sun's Rays put out the Fire</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  285.).&mdash;It is known that solar light contains three distinct kinds
  of rays, which, when decomposed by a prism, form as many spectra, varying
  in properties as well as in position, viz. luminous, heating or
  calorific, and chemical or actinic rays.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the rays of heat are even less refrangible than
  the least refrangible rays of light, while the chemical rays are more
  refrangible than either. The latter are so called from their power of
  inducing many chemical changes, such as the decomposition of water by
  chlorine, and the reactions upon which photographic processes depend.</p>

  <p>The relative quantities of these several kinds of rays in sun-light
  varies with the time of day, the season, and the latitude of any spot. In
  general, where the luminous and heating rays are most abundant, the
  proportion of chemical rays is least; and, in fact, the two seem
  antagonistic to each other. Thus, near the equator, the luminous and
  calorific rays being most powerful, the chemical are feeble, as is shown
  by the length of time required for the production of photographic
  pictures. Hence, also, June and July are the worst months for the
  practice of photography, and better results are obtained before noon than
  after.</p>

  <p>It is precisely for a similar reason that the combustion of an
  ordinary fire, being strictly a chemical change, is retarded whenever the
  sun's heating and luminous rays are most powerful, as during bright <!--
  Page 440 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page440"></a>{440}</span>sunshine, and that observe our fires to
  burn more briskly in summer than winter; in fact, that apparently "the
  sun's rays put out the fire."</p>

  <p><i>Spontaneous Combustion</i> (Vol. vii., p. 286.).&mdash;A most
  interesting discussion of this question is to be found in Liebig's
  <i>Familiar Letters upon Chemistry</i>.</p>

  <p>That chemist proves conclusively:&mdash;1. That of the cases adduced
  none is well authenticated, while in most it is admitted that the victims
  were drunkards, and that generally a candle or lamp was in the room, and
  after the alleged combustion was found turned over. 2. That spontaneous
  combustion is absolutely impossible, the human frame containing 75 or 80
  per cent. of water; and since flesh, when saturated with alcohol, is not
  consumed upon the application of a light, the alcohol burning off first,
  the causes assigned to account for the spontaneous ignition are <i>à
  priori</i> extremely improbable.</p>

  <p><i>Ecclesia Anglicana</i> (Vol. vii., p. 12.).&mdash;This has always
  been the appellation of the Church of England, just as much before the
  Reformation as after. I copy for G.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;M. one rather forcible sentence
  from the articles of a provincial synod, holden <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1257:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Et super istis articulis prænotatis fecit Bonifacius, Cant. Arch.
  suorum suffraganeorum sibi subditorum universorum, prælatorum pariter et
  cleri procuratorum, convocationem isto anno apud Londonias semel et

  <p>For other examples of the ante-reformational use of <i>Ecclesia

  <i>passim</i>; to the Writs for Parliament and Mandates for Convocation
  contained in the Appendix to Wake's <i>State of the Church and

  <p><i>Wyle Cop</i> (Vol. iv., pp. 116. 243. 509.; Vol. v., p. 44.; Vol.
  vi., p. 65.).&mdash;The summit of a steep hill in the town of Shrewsbury
  bears the name of <i>The Wyle Cop</i>. I think that these are two Welsh
  words, <i>Gwyl Cop</i>, meaning watch mound, slightly altered.
  <i>Gop</i>, near Newmarket in Flintshire, has a longer Welsh name, which
  is written by English people <i>Coperleni</i>. This, when correctly
  written, means, the mound of the light or fire-beacon. <i>Mole Cop</i>,
  the name of a lofty hill near Congleton, appears to be a slight
  corruption of the Welsh words <i>Moel y Cop</i>, the mountain of the
  mound. There is another lofty hill in Staffordshire called <i>Stiles
  Cop</i>. It seems probable that on both of these hills mounds may have
  been made in ancient times for the erection of fire-beacons. It would
  appear that Dr. Plot did not understand the Welsh language, as he has
  stated that he thought, in these instances, the word <i>Cop</i> meant a
  mountain.</p>

  <p><i>Chaucer</i> (Vol. vii., p. 356).&mdash;No foreign original has ever
  been found for Chaucer's "House of Fame." Warton fancied that it had been
  translated or paraphrased from the Provençal, but could adduce no proof
  that it had. Old Geoffrey may have found the groundwork somewhere, in the
  course of his multifarious reading; but the main portion of the structure
  is evidently the work of his own hands, as the number of personal details
  and circumstances would tend to indicate. The forty lines comprising the
  "Lai of Marie," which Chaucer has worked up into the "Nonnes Preestes
  Tale" of some seven hundred lines, are printed in Tyrwhitt's Introductory
  Discourse to the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, and will be sufficient to show
  what use he made of the raw material at his disposal. We may fairly
  presume that Emerson never took the trouble to investigate the matter,
  but contented himself with snatching up his materials from the nearest
  quarry, and then tumbling them out to the public.</p>

  <p><i>Campvere, Privileges of</i> (Vol. vii., p. 262.).&mdash;J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;S.
  asks, "What were these privileges, and whence was the term Campvere
  derived?"</p>

  <p>In Scotland there exists an ancient institution called "The Convention
  of Royal Burghs," which still meets annually in Edinburgh, under the
  fixed presidency of the Lord Provost of that city. It is a representative
  body, consisting of delegates elected by the town councils of the royal
  burghs (not <i>boroughs</i>) of Scotland; and their business is to attend
  to such public measures as may affect the general interests of their
  constituents. In former times, however their powers and duties were of
  far more importance than they are now. The Convention seems to have
  exercised a general superintendence of the foreign trade of the kingdom.
  With a view to the promotion of that trade, they used to enter into
  commercial treaties, or <i>staple contracts</i> as they were called, with
  the commercial cities of the Continent; and I have now before me one of
  these staple contracts, made with the city of Antwerp in 1540; and
  another with the city of Middleburg, in Zeeland, in 1541; but latterly
  they seem to have confined themselves to the town of <i>Campvere</i>, in
  Zeeland (island of Walcheren). In all these contracts it was stipulated
  <!-- Page 441 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page441"></a>{441}</span>that the Scottish traders should enjoy
  certain privileges, which were considered of such importance that the
  crown appointed a <i>conservator</i> of them. The last of these staple
  contracts was made with Campvere in the year 1747; but soon afterwards
  the increasing prosperity of Scotland, and the participation of its
  burgesses in the foreign trade of England, rendered such partial
  arrangements useless, and the contracts and the privileges have long
  since been reckoned among the things that were. The office of conservator
  degenerated into a sinecure. It was held for some time by the <i>Rev.</i>
  John Home, author of the tragedy of <i>Douglas</i>, who died in 1808; and
  afterwards by a Sir Alex. Lenier, whose name is found in the <i>Edinburgh
  Almanack</i> as "Conservator at Campvere" till 1847, when the office and
  the officer seem to have expired together.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Gilbert Gerard</i> (Vol. v., pp. 511. 571.).&mdash;In addition
  to the information I formerly sent you in answer to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Spedding's</span> inquiry, I am now enabled to state two facts, which
  greatly reduce the period within which the date of Sir Gilbert Gerard's
  death may be fixed. Among the records in Carlton Ride, is an enrolment of
  his account as <i>Custos Domûs Conversorum</i> from January 29, 34 Eliz.
  (1592) to January 29, 35 Eliz. (1593). And a search in Doctors' Commons
  has resulted in the discovery, that Sir Gilbert's will was proved, not,
  as Dugdale states, in April, 1592, but on April 6, 1593. He died
  therefore between January 29 and April 6, 1593.</p>

  <p>Dugdale mentions that there is no epitaph on his monument.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward Foss.</span></p>

  <p><i>Mistletoe</i> (Vol. vii., p. 270.).&mdash;I wish to mention that
  the mistletoe has been tried at the Botanic Gardens belonging to Trinity
  College, Dublin; and, after flourishing for some years, it died away.
  Indeed, I think it has been repeatedly tried there, but without eventual
  success.</p>

  <p class="author">Y. S. M.</p>

  <p class="address">Dublin.</p>

  <p><i>Wild Plants and their Names</i> (Vol. vii., p.

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Because they strengthen the brain and nerves, and remedy palsies, the
  Greeks gave them the name <i>paralysis</i>." "The flowers preserved, or
  conserved, and the quantity of a nutmeg taken every morning, is a
  sufficient dose for inward disorders."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>For the ointment he gives the following receipt:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Bruise the <i>flowers</i>; and to two handfuls of these, add a pound
  of hog's grease dried. Put it in a stone pot, covered with paper, and set
  it in the sun or a warm place three or four days to melt. Take it out and
  boil it a little; strain it out when hot; pressing it out very hard in a
  press. To this grease add as many herbs as before, and repeat the whole
  process, if you wish the ointment strong.&mdash;Yet this I tell you, the
  fuller of juice the herbs are, the sooner will your ointment be strong;
  the last time you boil it, boil it so long till your herbs be crisp, and
  the juice consumed; then strain it, pressing it hard in a press; and to
  every pound of ointment, add two ounces of turpentine, and as much
  wax."</p>

  <p><i>Coninger or Coningry, Coneygar or Conygre</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 182.

  bear the name of <i>conigree</i>. In some instances they are in the
  vicinity of manor-houses. The British name of a rabbit is
  <i>cwningen</i>, plural <i>cwning</i>. That of a rabbit warren is
  <i>cwning-gaer</i>, that is, literally, rabbits' camp. The term
  <i>coneygar</i> is so like this, that it may be supposed to have been
  derived from it.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>It would be difficult to find a book better calculated to prove the
  good service which the Camden Society is rendering to historical
  literature, than the one which has just been circulated among its
  members. The work, which is entitled <i>Letters and Papers of the Verney
  Family down to the end of the year 1639. Printed from the original MSS.
  in the possession of Sir Harry Verney, Bart., edited by</i> John Bruce,
  Esq., Treas. S.&nbsp;A., is of direct historical value, although at the first
  glance it would seem rather to illustrate the fortunes of the Verneys
  than the history of the country. For, as the editor well
  observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The most valuable materials, even for general history, are to be
  found among the records of private and personal experience. More true
  knowledge of the spirit of an age, more real acquaintance with the
  feelings and actual circumstances of a people, may be gleaned from a
  delineation of the affairs of a single family, than from studied
  historical composition. The one is the expression of cotemporary and
  spontaneous feeling, and, although limited, is unquestionably genuine;
  the other is a deduction from knowledge, imperfect even when most
  extensive, and too frequently coloured by the feelings and prejudices of
  a subsequent and altered period."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But, valuable as are the materials which the liberality of Sir Harry
  Verney has placed at the disposal of the Society, it is obvious that they
  are of a nature which a publisher might hesitate to produce, even if
  their owner, which is very doubtful, had thought fit to place them in the
  hands of one for that purpose. Hence the utility of a society which has
  influence to draw from the muniment rooms of our old families, such
  materials as those found in the present volume, and which, strung
  together with the agreeable and instructive narrative with which Mr.
  Bruce has accompanied them, will secure for the <i>Verney Papers</i> the
  character of being one of the very best, as well as of the most amusing
  books, which the Camden Society has given to the world. <!-- Page 442

  <p>Having had an opportunity of being present at the private view of

  productions which have come before the public. We strongly advise our
  readers to visit this exhibition, that they may see the rapid progress
  which the art is making, and how applicable it is to their archæological
  pursuits.</p>

<h3>Notices to Correspondents.</h3>

  <p><i>Owing to a necessity for going to press this week at an unusually
  early period, that the present Number might be included in the Monthly
  Part, we are compelled to omit replies to many Correspondents.</i></p>

  <p>L. A. M. (Great Yarmouth) <i>will find several Notes respecting the
  means of discovering the bodies of the drowned in our</i> 4th Vol., pp.
  148. 251. 297.</p>

  <p>H. O. N. (Brighton). <i>In our own practice we have never obtained
  pictures with the agreeable colour which is produced by the iodide of
  silver, when iodide of ammonium has been used. The flaking of the
  collodion would indicate an excess of iodide, and is often cured by the
  addition of about twenty drops of alcohol to an ounce of collodion. The
  feathery appearance is difficult to comprehend, without seeing a
  specimen. If you are using glass which has been previously used, the most
  minute remains of iron would cause a discoloration. Muriatic acid is the
  most effectual remedy for cleaning glass so used. It may be procured
  at</i> 2½d. <i>per lb., and should be diluted with three parts of
  water.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">An Amateur</span> (Oxford). <i>We are not of opinion
  that Mr. Talbot could restrain any one from taking collodion portraits,
  as patentee of the Talbotype process. It is done in many parts of London
  daily without any permission.&mdash;See </i>Times'<i> Advertisements,
  &amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>C. E. F. <i>We think you use too strong a solution of the
  ammonio-nitrate of silver: thirty grains to the ounce of water, and then
  redissolved with the strong liq. ammon., give to us most satisfactory
  result,&mdash;the paper being prepared before with chloride of barium,
  chloride of sodium, and chloride of ammonia, of each half a drachm to the
  quart of water, in which half an ounce of mannite, or sugar of milk, has
  been previously dissolved. When sufficiently printed, put it into the
  hypo. sulph. solution, without previous immersion.</i></p>

  <p>H. L. L. <i>We shall be happy to render you the best assistance we
  can, if you will communicate with us again. For iodized paper we may

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>
